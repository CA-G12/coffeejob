## **About Our Website** <span id="about"></span>


**What?**

This is a job search engine website that provides you with companies that offer jobs in your field of expertise. It also has an auto-complete function that allows you search more easily. 

On the client side, the website provides an easy-to-use user interface, along with a design that maximizes the user experience quality. On the server side, the website is equipped with an efficient functionality that performs fast processes.

**Why?**

Our service seeks to become a connector between companies that offer jobs and people that seek them. This way, we remove the difficult process of searching for opportunities and also help companies in their hiring process. 

**How?**

_Planning Phase_:

- We have came with the idea of Coffeejob when we thought of a coffeeshop that provides you with cups of jobs instead of coffee. 
- Sitemap consisted of 1 page that has a search bar and a results section. 
- We assessed the tasks we needed to accomplish as well as our skillsets.
- And finally we divided up the workload accordingly.

_Development Phase_:

The team agreed on guidelines to follow during development. The technologies and guidelines that we agreed to use and follow are:

- **UI=>Figma:** to build the design.
- **HTML5:** to build the basic structure.
- **CSS3:** to style the website.
- **Javascript (JS):** to give the functions to all the static elements.
- **APIs:** to fetch the jobs data from the ADZUNA API.
- **Heroku:** for deployment.



## **User Stories** :books: <span id="stories"></span>

The user enters the website and types in the search bar. A list of suggestions come up that match what he is typing. 

Afterwards, he clicks on 'Search', and a list of jobs appear that match his search request. Each job has details about the salary, the company, and the location. Finally, if the user wanted to apply to the job, he can click on 'Apply'.
